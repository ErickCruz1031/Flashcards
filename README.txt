I worked alone in this project so I did not have a partner.
The name of my server file is ' flashcardServer.js' .
My port number is 53232
The name of the HTML file for the login page is "login.html" and the html page for the user page is "lango.html"
The URL for the login page of my app is the following: http://server162.site:53232/login.html 

Comments: I was able to get everything to work (At least I think) with the exception of the card-flipping animation. As such, when you press "Enter" the box will turn green
to indicate that you got it right or it will display the correct answer. I had trouble implementing the feature that allows you to "submit" your answer by simply clicking
anywhere in the page so you have to press "Enter" to check your answer.
